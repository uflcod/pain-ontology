AnnotationAssertion(rdfs:comment <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/PAIN_0000000> "a bodily process in an organism S involving two integrated levels:

  (a) activation of the nociceptive system and associated emotion generating brain components of S, and
 
  (b) a simultaneous aversive sensory and emotional experience on the part of S,
  
where (b) is phenomenologically similar to the sort of aversive experience involved in PCT pain.")
AnnotationAssertion(rdfs:comment <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/PAIN_0000000> "‘Phenomenologically similar’ means inter alia: (1) that the experience is ‘of’ or is ‘targeted towards’ some region R of the body of S, so that all pain is in this sense (and however diffusely) localized; (2) that the experience involves a dimension of unpleas- antness which – as is shown by the case of pain asymbolia – is not necessarily of the sort that involves suffering or aversion on the part of the subject S.
This definition is formulated in such a way that small children and even some ani- mals can experience canonical pain, even though they do not have the cognitive re- sources to represent their experience as one that is caused in this or that way. This ad- dresses one recognized shortcoming of the IASP definition [Rollin BE. Science and Ethics, Cambridge : Cambridge University Press, 2006.].")
